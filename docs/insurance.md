## Goals

The IBU Insurance agent chatbot helps IBU Insuranceâ€™s customer service representatives manage customer complaints about their claims handling. The chatbot is used by the customer service reps when a customer calls or writes with a complaint.

The chatbot should bring consistent responses and actionable decisions, which improves the complain management by more than 27% and improve the quality responses by 35% while reducing the cost by around 60%.

## Insurance context

In most insurance organization we may find the following roles Involved in Complaint Handling process:

The AI assistant will help the contact center agents.

## Build for demonstration

For development purpose build the DataManager microservice images:

```sh
cd datamgt
./build/buildImage.sh
```

The docker image for the DataManager microservice, the chatbot frontend and for the OWL Backend are available on docker hub.

## Run locally

To start all the components of the solution like the owl_backend, the owl_frontend, the data manager, postgresql database, and the ODM decision service, use the docker compose file locally under the `IBU-insurance-demo/deployment/local/` folder. 

```sh
docker-compose up -d 
```

The first time you launch it, it may take some time as it downloads the needed docker images.

Verify that the six containers are running:

```sh
docker ps
```

To look at owl-backend logs

```sh
docker logs owl-backend
```

Next see the demonstration script section, or the non-regression tests to automate scenario execution.

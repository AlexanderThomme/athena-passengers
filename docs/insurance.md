## Goals

The IBU Insurance agent chatbot helps IBU Insuranceâ€™s customer service representatives manage customer complaints about their claims handling. The chatbot is used by the customer service reps when a customer calls or writes with a complaint.

The chatbot should bring consistent responses and actionable decisions, which improves the complain management by more than 27% and improve the quality responses by 35% while reducing the cost by around 60%.
